Summary:
========

This directory contains the source code for X-Loader, an initial program
loader for Embedded boards based on OMAP processors. X-Loader can be
signed by Texas Instruments IFT and installed to Nand flash to achieve
Nand booting.


Status:
=======

The support for SOM336 evaluation boards from Elettronica GF S.r.l has been implemented
and tested. (Aug 2011)


Support for other OMAP boards can be added.
 
  
Directory Hierarchy:
====================

- board		Board dependent files
- cpu		CPU specific files
- drivers	Commonly used device drivers
- lib		Libraries
 
- cpu/arm926ejs Files specific to ARM 926 CPUs
- cpu/arm1136 Files specific to ARM 1136 CPUs
- cpu/omap3 Files specific to ARM CortexA8 CPU

 
- board/omap1710h3
		Files specific to OMAP 1710 H3 boards
- board/omap2420h4
		Files specific to OMAP 2420 H4 boards
- board/omap2430sdp
		Files specific to OMAP 2430 2430sdp boards
- board/omap3430sdp
		Files specific to OMAP 3420sdp boards
- board/omap3egf
		Files specific to SOM336 evaluation boards from Elettronica GF S.r.l

 
Software Configuration:
=======================
	cd x-loader-omap3
	make distclean
	make omap3egf_config

After a board has been configured, type "make" to build it supposing the
needed cross tools are in your path.
To specify your cross compiler you may need
ex:
make CROSS_COMPILE=arm-angstrom-linux-
 
Image Format:
=============

X-Loader expects OS boot loader (e.g. U-Boot) in Nand flash using
JFFS2 style ECC. 


Prepare Booting SD Card:
===========================

Follow the instructions at http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php?title=MMC_Boot_Format
to format correctly the SDCard.
Copy the MLO binary you find in x-loader-omap3 to the SDCARD FAT partition just created.
IMPORTANT! MLO should be the first file to be copied, before u-boot and uImage in order
to be allocated at the first sector.
